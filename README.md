# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Technically sound code ensures that the syntax is correct and that there are tests for inputs, including invalid input. Code should be efficient without cutting corners.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To make sure that code meets user needs and requirements, programmers should try to break down the requirements into a list and run through it to make they hit every mark.

# How do I approach designing software?
Software professionals adhere to a code of ethics and use a set of techniques and general principles to test code, and they do it early to prevent cost escalation. One of those guidelines is the Fundamental Test Process, which is made up of five steps. These steps may be revisited and some may be done in parallel:

1. Test planning and control
2. Test analysis and design
3. Test implementation and execution
4. Evaluating exit criteria and reporting
5. Test closure activities
